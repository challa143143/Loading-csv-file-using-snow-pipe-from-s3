---Loading csv file using snow pipe from s3





What is Snowpipe?

-- Snowpipe enables loading data from files as soon as they’re available in a stage. 

-- This means you can load data from files in micro-batches, making it available to users within minutes, 

   rather than manually executing COPY statements on a schedule to load larger batches.



Here deleted the file name of s3 which I executed while loading csv file in the url section
And deleted the health file from s3 to check how it works
Created a snowpipe which automatically  ingests the data from s3 to snowflake 
And ran show pipes got an notification arn
Now I created a notification under s3 bucket proprties and entered urn 
Then I added file in s3 bucket csv folder
Now I executed select statement it fetches data and file was loaded
Here the thing is we don’t need to add all the files in the url 

The snowpipe which we created ingest data automatically but correct file should be there in s3
